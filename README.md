# ROCCA

Static homepage for the independent `rocca-concept-light` Vercel project.
Production: https://rocca-concept-light.vercel.app/

## Editing

- `index.html`: page content and semantic sections; no bundled/base64 images.
- `assets/css/main.css`: layout, responsive breakpoints, reduced-motion fallback.
- `assets/js/main.js`: mobile navigation, accessible process tabs, viewport-driven motion.
- `assets/main1–main7.webp`: optimized source images; `-800` variants for smaller screens.
- Serve locally with `python3 -m http.server 3000`. No build or dependencies required.

## Homepage flow

Hero → compact full-cycle introduction → solutions → portfolio requests → materials → process tabs with B2B callout → production capabilities → compact engineering → final CTA and calculation form.

The main action is “Рассчитать проект”; a mobile bottom action appears after the hero and hides at the contact form.

## Images

| Image | Current placement |
| --- | --- |
| main5 | Hero, eager loading and high fetch priority |
| main4 | Solution directions overview, conceptual illustration |
| main3 | Materials in architectural context |
| main8 | Engineering, conceptual illustration |

All original images and responsive variants remain in assets for future pages. Below-hero imagery is lazy loaded. No conceptual illustration is presented as a completed ROCCA case or a real manufacturing photograph.

## Pending integrations

See `content/README.md` for verified portfolio/production content slots, journal preservation, contacts and form integration. The frontend creates a mailto draft only. It does not send requests or upload files; attachments must be added manually.

Future material entries should use independent `material`, `application`, and `originCountry` fields without making country the primary navigation.


## Light comparison version

Copied from `nrgjam-source/rocca-concept` at `d748c7b7e217ff432462c838a93b8a069a841fc2`. The source dark repository and deployment are independent and must not be changed from this project.

Color overrides are isolated in `assets/css/light.css`. Page structure, content, images, fonts and animation scripts remain unchanged. Dark SVG outlines have light-theme graphite variants.

Search indexing is disabled using page robots metadata, `robots.txt`, and the `X-Robots-Tag` header in `vercel.json`.
